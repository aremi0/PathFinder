# PathFinder

Graphic application, written through processing, which implements two algorithms: search for one of the shortest path and search for one of the longest path.

Within a randomly generated grid, a TARGET will be randomly generated (0) and the minimum path weights will be calculated across the table:
  - Clicking with the left mouse button will highlight one of the shortest paths to the TARGET.

  - Right clicking will highlight one of the longest paths and show the number of steps from the clicked box to the TARGET (colored purple).
